//Binary search tree: We start with a root node with value x, where the left subtree of x contains nodes with values < x and the right subtree contains nodes whose values are â‰¥ x. Each node follows the same rules with respect to nodes in their left and right subtrees.
//BSTs are of interest because they have operations which are favourably fast: insertion, look up, and deletion can all be done in O(log n) time.
